SunLight project idea
=====================

Question to answer:
-------------------
- When will the sun shine through my window in my apartment at a given hour of a given day of the year?

Selling point: 
--------------
- for people who need a lot of sunlight for psychological reasons
- for anyone wanting to wake up for natural light in the morning
- for people who like to have plants with high light need in their aparment

Data wishlist:
--------------
- height data of buildings
- climate data

Data:
-----
- ground elevation
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/
- building map and height data

- sun's position vs location and day
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_of_the_Sun

Tools:
------
- osm2xml export (either the API, or sth other)
- beautifulsoup to parse xml in python

1. 
	Problem:
		- How much sunlight does a given apartment (or office) get in Manhattan?
		- subproblems: 
			+ During what ours does the sun shine through the window?
			+ How much sun does the place get thoughout the year? (hours + power)
	Format:
		- web app
		- input 1: address
		- output 1: top view of the building and its immediate environment
		- input 2: user selects the facade (dropdown, or click)


2. 
	Data description:
		- OpenStreetMap data stored in OSM files
		- can be exported to XML
		- building geometries are stored as nodes with "building" key
		- buildings in Manhattan are all accessible
		- Sun's position on the sky from Wikipedia formula
	Graph:
		- plot of Sun's position
		- plot of buildings siluette
		- planB: screenshot from 
		http://osmbuildings.org/?lat=40.78251&lon=-73.96590&zoom=15


3.
	Methods/Steps:
		- Convert OSM to XML
		- use beautifulsoup to parse XML
		- store it in SQL database
		- for building, floor, facade of building and day, set by the user, 
			+ display Sun's path
			+ display siluette of building blocking the view
			+ calculate sunlight vs minutes
			+ plot radiation power as a function of time
		- create summaries for around the year for a single location
			+ total sunlight compared and maximum vs days of the year

TODO list:
----------
--OK-- 1. Fetch 3D building data of Manhattan
--OK-- 2. Save it in XML locally
3. Parse XML with beautifulsoup
4. Save parsed data to SQL database
5. Figure out GPS coordinates from address
6. Write queries: Address -> building in SQL database
7. Floor number + orientation -> height
8. Calculate the Sun's position for each minute of the day
9. For each position of the Sun, loop through the buildings which are only in the line of sight in top-view
10. Check if any of the facets of the building is in the way of the Sun
